This is an image classification project of CIFAR 10 dataset

* Achieved an accuracy of about 85% in object classification by designing and training a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras, effectively distinguishing between multiple object categories.

* Enhanced model generalisation through data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping and zooming, leading to robust performance across diverse image datasets and reduced overftting by implementing regularisation techniques like dropout and batch normalisation.
